# About this code

## Purpose
This program analyses response data for a Discrete Choice Experiment study that is currently being written up. Future versions of this program will include details of the parent study.

The analysis algorithm implemented by this code performs the following tasks:

- ingest and pre-process survey datasets;
- generate descriptive statistics and plots;
- develop and test choice models; and
- apply choice models to multiple analytic tasks.
