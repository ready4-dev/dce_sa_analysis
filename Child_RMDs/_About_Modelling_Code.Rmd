# About this code

## Purpose
This program is used to fit choice models to a dataset from a Discrete Choice Experiment study that is currently being written up. Future versions of this program will include details of the parent study.

This program fits models that explore:

- how choice attributes affect the responses of our sample;
- the heterogeneity of these impacts within our sample;
- how individual respondent characteristics interacted with choice attributes; and 
- whether we can identify distinct sub-groups based on preference profile.
