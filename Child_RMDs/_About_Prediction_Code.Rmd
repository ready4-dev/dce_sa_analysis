# About this code

## Purpose
This program makes predictions using models derived from a Discrete Choice Experiment study that is currently being written up. Future versions of this program will include details of the parent study.

The predictions generated by this program can be used to predict willingness to pay values and market shares of alternative hypothetical social anxiety apps.
