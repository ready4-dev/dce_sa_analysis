## Status
This code is the same version as was used to analyse study data. The only items that have been modified are those that remove references to the local directory structure on which study data was stored.

## Use
This code can be run either by "knitting" the parent RMD file or by manually executing each code chunk. The code as is currently optimised for being knit in one step, which means that in a number of instance the value "Y" has been supplied to the `consent_1L_chr` argument of program functions. Supplying this value overrides the default behaviour of functions that write files which is to prompt users for their active consent prior to to write files and directories to their machine. If running this code interactively, we recommend omitting the `consent_1L_chr` argument as this will provide you with greater transparency about what files and directories are being written to your machine.
