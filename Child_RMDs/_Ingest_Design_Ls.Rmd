### Ingest data on choice features
We next retrieve data on the choices that participants were presented with from the code we previously ran to create the choice cards. 

```{r eval=params$eval_1L_lgl}
dce_design_ls <- readRDS(paste0(paths_ls$Replication,"/dce_design_ls.RDS")) # Need to change to get data from online repo
```
