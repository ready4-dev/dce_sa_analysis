### Ingest data on choice features
We next retrieve data on the choices that participants were presented with from the code we previously ran to create the choice cards. 

```{r eval=params$eval_1L_lgl}
X <- Ready4useRepos(dv_nm_1L_chr = "springtolife", 
                    dv_ds_nm_1L_chr = "https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VGPIPS", 
                    dv_server_1L_chr = "dataverse.harvard.edu")
dce_design_ls <- ingest(X,
                        fls_to_ingest_chr = "DDD_final_dce_design_ls",
                        metadata_1L_lgl = F)
```
